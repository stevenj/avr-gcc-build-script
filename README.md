# avr-gcc-build-script

Script to build avr-gcc 9.1 AND avr-libc3, with built in support for Xmega3 devices

Based on the script from http://blog.zakkemble.net/avr-gcc-builds

AVR-LIBC is being fetched from the AVR-LIBC3 fork, to allow updated verisons of AVR-LIBC to be built that include things NOT in the official old release.
