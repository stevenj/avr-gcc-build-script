# avr-gcc-build-script
Script to build avr-gcc 9.1 AND avr-libc latest, with built in support for Xmega3 devices

Based on the script from http://blog.zakkemble.net/avr-gcc-builds
the modifications are minor, simply to use SVN version rather than the latest release, and apply the latest patch for Xmega3 devices.
